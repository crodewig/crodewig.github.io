The heartrending beauty of the Little Angels, a children’s folk ballet hailing from South Korea, is one of the chief reasons I have added that country to my bucket list. Any nation that can produce something this graceful compels me to go there. Elaborate, layered costuming, hauntingly lovely music on traditional instruments like the gayageum and ancient Korean stories told through movement — the performance ranks among the best I have ever seen.
