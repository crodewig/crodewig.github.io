Who would expect this eerie, lovely landscape so close to Atlanta? The site of a former granite quarry, [Arabia Mountain][0] is now a nature preserve. It boasts miles of trails, rare plant life and stunning, surreal panoramas of topography so alien it feels almost lunar. Go after heavy rain, when the face of the mountain fills with shallow pools.
