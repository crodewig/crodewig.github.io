I’m something of a waterfall fanatic. I try to rank them by grandeur, loveliness, by the degrees of awe they inspire. It’s impossible, of course, but this [DeSoto Falls][0] is picturesque in the extreme. A powerful plunge. A limpid blue pool. Stark natural beauty. Ah, ye poets of the sublime… pack your bags — we goin’ to Alabama.
