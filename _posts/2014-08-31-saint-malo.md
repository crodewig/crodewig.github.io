If you’re visiting Mont Saint-Michel, you must stop by its neighbor, Saint-Malo. The medieval town draws visitors from around the world with its scenic beaches and rich history.

If you don’t have time or inclination to stop into one of its many museums or historic buildings, climb along the rocks by the water at low tide or walk by the walls of this ancient fortified city. In the summer months, Saint-Malo hums with tourists, but in early spring and late fall, it’s much quieter — a beautiful stretch of Brittany coast and cobblestone streets waiting for exploration.
