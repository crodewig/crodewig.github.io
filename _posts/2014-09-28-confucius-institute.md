If you live in Georgia, go see the [Confucius Institute][0] at Kennesaw State University. The organization hosts free performances throughout the year, including a range of dance — martial arts to modern. The dances are more than fluid movement. They are culture, costumes, music and storytelling woven from the rich fabric of China’s history.
