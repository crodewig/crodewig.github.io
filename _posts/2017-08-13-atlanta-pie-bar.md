I really like pie.

Cake, cookies and candy are sweet, sure, but they don’t seem nearly as sophisticated as layers of fruit and cream in a soft, flaky crust. It’s a personal preference. There are two kinds of people: those who prefer cake and those who prefer pie. I’m firmly on Team Pie.

So naturally when I heard about Atlanta’s nightly pie bar at one of its posh downtown restaurants, I had to give it a try. For just $9, you can sample from about a dozen desserts, including gluten-free parfaits, tiny delectable tarts and pie slices so large that balancing them long enough to land them safely on your plate is no small feat.
