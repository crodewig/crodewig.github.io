Millions of daffodils, dogwoods, roses, rhododendrons, wildflowers and more blanket the manicured grounds of [Gibbs Gardens][0] each year.

Reminiscent of a European pleasure garden, the 300-acre estate showcases waterfalls, terraces, fountains, reflecting ponds, arbors, islands, sculptures and bridges, all artistically dripping and draped with greens and blooms. For the photographer or nature lover, this is heaven.
