The Queen City is a vacationer’s delight. If you’re like me and enjoy packing a lot into a long weekend, Charlotte is a must-see destination.

You can spend a full day downtown, walking through the quaint parks and photographing outdoor art and scenic fountains.

There’s a great selection of restaurants downtown. If you’re looking for something special, don’t miss [Aria Tuscan Grill][0].

Aria is an upscale Italian eatery that’s the perfect spot for a romantic meal that won’t break the bank. To me, Italian restaurants are a dime a dozen and I rarely eat pasta when I’m out, but their gnocchi appetizer was a revelation that we’ll quite literally be referring to for years to come. It’s one of those memories that turns into family lore — “remember that one time we had that gnocchi with pear, gorgonzola and truffle oil?” The main dishes are stellar, too, and the pizza is thin crust and oh-so-fresh.

Beyond downtown, there’s the U.S. National Whitewater Center, which deserves a day to itself for rafting, rock climbing, kayaking and ziplining. The kayaking really takes some muscle when you’re returning upstream.

And then there are the escape games. (We love [escape games][1].) With so many rooms to choose from, it’s hard to know which to pick. If you can only do one, visit [Black Out][2]. The customer service and theatrical experience set them apart, and the puzzles are both clever and fun.
