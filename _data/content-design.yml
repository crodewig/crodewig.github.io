- title: Web Content Redesign

    I hired and collaborated with a web developer to redesign the KSU CPE
    website. During this process, I identified key user problems, developed
    content solutions to address them, conducted UX testing, and managed the
    project, from inception to launch.
  client: Kennesaw State University
  methodology: Card sort, usability testing, research, accessibility optimization
  results: 14% higher conversion rate, 8% lower bounce rate, 14% longer spent on site

    I love helping small businesses understand how their marketing is working.
    For this project, I worked with a local company to give them practical
    insight into their customers via an easy-to-use dashboard.
  client: The Escapery
  process: Client interview, dashboard creation, recommendations report

- title: Newsletter design
  text: >-
    Readers want to find the info they need at a glance. For this redesign, I
    focused on chunked content so people can skim — and I kept the layout clean,
    open and vibrant so they’d want to stay.
  client: Columbus Botanical Garden
  process: Client interview, template mockup, revisions, final newsletter creation
  tools: Adobe InDesign, Adobe Photoshop
