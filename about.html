      <p>
        I started as a public affairs photojournalist nearly 15 years ago after graduating at the top of my class (with
        the <a href="http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/en-US/display/20072008/HR/289" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">state
          legislation</a> to prove it).
      </p>
      <p>
        Because I love stories, I began experimenting with all the ways to share them, illustrate them and even measure them. That's why my content expertise today is broad. It includes:

      <ul>
        <li><a href="/portfolio/content-design">Content strategy</a> and design</li>
        <li>Hiring and managing content teams</li>

  <h2 class="h4">Cheryl, are you really that great at all those things?</h2>
  <p>Nah. I'm an expert writer and content manager, a middling videographer and a mere dilettante when it comes to web
    design (which is why I hire a pro for redesigns <a href="https://cpe.kennesaw.edu" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">like this one</a>). But where I
    really excel is applying an analytical approach to solving creative problems. Here's some stuff I'm proud of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Where my words have ended up, like <a
        href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/29/manatees-facing-increased-threats-during-the-pandemic"
        rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Guardian</a> and <a
        href="https://www.hertz.com/blog/travel/things-to-do/things-atlanta-top-spots-food-art-entertainment"
        rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hertz</a></li>
    <li><a href="/portfolio/content-design">This content design project</a> that led to a 14% higher site conversion
      rate</li>
    <li>Getting a 4.0 in my MBA program (despite ECON 8010)</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2292393" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Teaching marketing</a> at
      Kennesaw State University</li>
    <li>Two national awards for marketing campaigns and one state-level award for feature journalism</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="h4">Do you do anything else besides work?</h2>
  <p>Why, yes, I do. Iâ€™m touched that you should ask. I love reading, traveling, volunteering with nonprofits, hiking and
    cuddling small- to medium-sized animals. I also enjoy luring unsuspecting family members into playing word games like Taboo so I can win (though I've currently run out of family members for this). I cook a lot, too: cauliflower curry,
    shakshuka and weird experiments with avocado. And I'm a bit of a personal finance junkie.</p>
