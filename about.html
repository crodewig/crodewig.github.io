        I started as a public affairs photojournalist nearly 15 years ago after
        graduating at the top of my class (with the

        to prove it).

        Because I love stories, I began experimenting with all the ways to share
        them, illustrate them and even measure them. That's why my content
        expertise today is broad. It includes:

  <h2 class="h4">Cheryl, are you really that great at all those things?</h2>
  <p>
    Nah. I'm an expert writer and content manager, a middling videographer and a
    mere dilettante when it comes to web design (which is why I hire a pro for
    redesigns
    <a href="https://cherylrodewig.com/portfolio/content-design/"
      >like this one</a
    >). But where I really excel is applying an analytical approach to solving
    creative problems. Here's some stuff I'm proud of:

  <h2 class="h4">Do you do anything else besides work?</h2>
  <p>
    Why, yes, I do. Iâ€™m touched that you should ask. I love reading, traveling,
    volunteering with nonprofits, hiking and cuddling small- to medium-sized
    animals. I also enjoy luring unsuspecting family members into playing word
    games like Taboo so I can win (though I've currently run out of family
    members for this). I cook a lot, too: cauliflower curry, shakshuka and weird
    experiments with avocado. And I'm a bit of a personal finance junkie.
